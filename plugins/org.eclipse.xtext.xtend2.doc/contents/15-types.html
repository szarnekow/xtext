<h1>Types</h1>
<p>
Xtend completely supports Java&apos;s type system: The primitive types as <span class="inlinecode"><span class="keyword">int</span></span> or 
<span class="inlinecode"><span class="keyword">boolean</span></span> are available as well as all classes and interfaces that reside on the 
classpath.  
</p>
<p>
Java Generics are fully supported, such that you can define type parameters and type arguments 
in just the same way as in Java.
</p>
<p>
As Xtend classes compile to Java classes, you can integrate both Java classes in Xtend and Xtend 
classes in Java. Note that Xtend does not have an own syntax for interfaces, as the Java syntax is 
already very concise.

<h2>Conformance and Conversion</h2>
<p>
Conformance is used in order to find out whether some expression can be used in a certain situation. 
For instance when assigning a value to a variable, the type of the right hand expression needs to 
conform to the type of the variable.
</p>
<p>
As Xbase implements the unchanged type system of Java it also fully supports the conformance rules 
defined in <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/conversions.html">The Java Language Specification</a>.
